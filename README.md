# hotRestaurant

Basic app demonstrating Node and Express with jQuery. Overall purpose is to help schedule reservation requests. Restaurant has just 5 tables available. First five requests get a reservation, every request after that is sent to the waiting list.

Application will be made up of two parts: 
1) A front-end set of HTML/CSS/JS pages for entering and viewing data and 
2) A back-end composed of Node/Express and basic JS for storing, updating, and relaying reservation data.

Spend the time necessary to map this application out. Consider the concepts we've covered in class so far:

* Servers
* Routing
* APIs
* AJAX (GET and POST Requests)
